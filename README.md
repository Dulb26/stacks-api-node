# Stacks API Node easy start

## Quickstart

**IMPORTANT:** You need to install Docker before running the next command. Install it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

Open a terminal of some sort:

- macOS - Terminal
- Windows 10 - Console
- Windows 11 - Windows Terminal
- Linux - if you are using Linux, you should know how to use a terminal... lol

This command:

1. Downloads this code
2. Enters the folder
3. Starts the quickstart sequence

```sh
git clone https://github.com/syvita/stacks-api-node
cd stacks-api-node
sh start
```

The quickstart sequence:

1. Downloads the Stacks node code
2. Downloads the Stacks API code
3. Builds the Stacks node to run on your system (can take upwards of 10min)
4. Builds the Stacks API to run on your system (usually around 5min)
5. Boots up the database, node, API and explorer 

It can take anywhere from a few hours to weeks to sync up to the blockchain based on how fast your internet connection is. The API might take a while to be available.

More details are shown in your console after the bootup sequence.
