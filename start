echo "\nYou now have a:
- Stacks node running on ports 20443 & 20444
- API available at http://localhost:3999 (with 3700 for the Stacks node to send events to)
- Postgres database (used for the API) on port 5432
- Syvirean Explorer available at http://localhost:3099

Make sure to wait a while for the node to fully sync.

‚ÑπÔ∏è  This could take a few hours to a week or so depending on how fast your connection is.

After you're fully synced up, you'll be able to switch your wallets over to use your local API.

You won't need to use Syvita's or Hiro's explorer either - just use yours running on http://localhost:3099

Congrats again! Welcome to the Revolution! ‚öíÔ∏è  üî•"
